# Project-Imitatum-Record-Terminal
This application is for use in a D&amp;D session, where my players can interact with a computer terminal at the antagonists base, detailing records on 'project imitatum', where half the staff of a black ops organization are 'imitations' (robots, not 'alive'), and stats ironically reflecting this are displayed. This is my first program written in C.
